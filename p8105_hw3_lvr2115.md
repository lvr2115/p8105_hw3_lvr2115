# Problem 1

The dataset is 1384617 rows and 15 columns. The 15 variables are
add_to_cart_order, aisle, aisle_id, days_since_prior_order, department,
department_id, eval_set, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, order_id,
order_number, product_id, product_name, reordered, user_id. Each row in
this dataset represents an object that was ordered from Instacart. There
are variables to identify the order itself, including user ID
(‘user_id’), the order in which items were added to the cart
(‘add_to_cart_order’), and the order ID (‘order_id’). There are
variables to describe the items ordered per say, such as department
(‘department’ and ‘department_id’), the name of the product
(‘product_name’), and the aisle in which the product is found (‘aisle’
and ‘aisle_id’), and whether or not the item has been ordered by this
user previously (‘reordered’). In total, there are 39123 products found
in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

There are 134 aisles and the aisles from which the most items are
ordered from are fresh vegetables and fresh fruits.

This plot shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, only
including aisles with more than 10000 items ordered, shown in ascending
order.

“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”,
including the number of times each item is ordered.

## Data cleaning

``` r
brfss_smart2010_clean = janitor::clean_names(brfss_smart2010)
brfss_smart2010_overallhealth = filter(brfss_smart2010_clean, topic=="Overall Health" | response=="Excellent:Poor") |>
  mutate(recode_factor(response, "Poor" = "1", "Fair" = "2", "Good" = "3", "Very Good" = "4", "Very good" = "4", "Excellent" = "5"))
```

In 2002, these states were observed at 7 or more locations. \#HELP

In 2010, these states were observed at 7 or more locations. \#HELP

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help). \#HELP

``` r
brfss_excellent = filter(brfss_smart2010_overallhealth, response == "Excellent")
brfss_excellent |>
  group_by(locationabbr) |>
  summarize(
    avg_data_value = mean(data_value)
  ) |>
ggplot(aes(x = avg_data_value, y = locationabbr, color = locationabbr)) + 
    geom_point() + geom_line() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

## Uploading and cleaning datasets

``` r
accelerometer = 
  read_csv("./nhanes_accel.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names(case="snake") |>
  drop_na() 
```

``` r
demographic = 
  read_csv("./nhanes_covar.csv",  skip = 4) |> 
  janitor::clean_names(case="snake") |>
  drop_na() |>
  filter(age>20) |>
  mutate(
    sex = 
      case_match(
        sex, 
        1 ~ "male", 
        2 ~ "female"), 
    sex = as.factor(sex),
    education = as.factor(education)
  )
```

## Merging datasets

``` r
merged_nhanes = 
  full_join(demographic, accelerometer, by = c("seqn")) |>
  drop_na()
```

## Table for the number of men and women in each education category

``` r
merged_nhanes |>

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each participant. Plot these total
activities (y-axis) against age (x-axis); your plot should compare men
to women and have separate panels for each education level. Include a
trend line or a smooth to illustrate differences.

``` r
merged_nhanes |>
  group_by(seqn) |>
  summarize(total_activity=sum(min1:min1440))
```

    ## # A tibble: 228 × 2
    ##     seqn total_activity
    ##    <dbl>          <dbl>
    ##  1 62161          1.11 
    ##  2 62164          8.77

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each education level and use color to indicate sex. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph;
including smooth trends may help identify differences.
