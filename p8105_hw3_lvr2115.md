# Problem 1

The dataset is 1384617 rows and 15 columns. The 15 variables are
add_to_cart_order, aisle, aisle_id, days_since_prior_order, department,
department_id, eval_set, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, order_id,
order_number, product_id, product_name, reordered, user_id. Each row in
this dataset represents an object that was ordered from Instacart. There
are variables to identify the order itself, including user ID
(‘user_id’), the order in which items were added to the cart
(‘add_to_cart_order’), and the order ID (‘order_id’). There are
variables to describe the items ordered per say, such as department
(‘department’ and ‘department_id’), the name of the product
(‘product_name’), and the aisle in which the product is found (‘aisle’
and ‘aisle_id’), and whether or not the item has been ordered by this
user previously (‘reordered’). In total, there are 39123 products found
in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

There are 134 aisles and the aisles from which the most items are
ordered from are fresh vegetables and fresh fruits.

This plot shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, only
including aisles with more than 10000 items ordered, shown in ascending
order.

This dataset is limited to ‘Excellent’ responses, and contains: year,
state, and a variable that averages the data_value across locations
within a state named “avg_data_value”. This plot shows the average value
over time within a state.

``` r
brfss_excellent = filter(brfss_smart2010_overallhealth, response == "Excellent") 

brfss_excellent |>
  group_by(state, year) |>
  summarize(
    avg_data_value = mean(data_value,  na.rm = TRUE)) |>
        select(state, year, avg_data_value) |>
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value, group=state, color = state)) + 
    geom_point() + geom_line(alpha =0.6) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'state'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

This is a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010, the
distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
ny_response = 
  brfss_smart2010_overallhealth |> 
  filter(state == "NY", year %in% c(2006, 2010)) |>
  select(state, year, response, data_value)

ggplot(ny_response, aes(x = response, y = data_value, fill=response)) + geom_boxplot() +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
   facet_grid(.~year) + 
  labs(
      x= "Response",
      y="Data value for Responses to Overall Health",

```

![](p8105_hw3_lvr2115_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

In both years, the highest average data value among all 5 response
groups is highest for those who responded “Very Good”. Additionally, for
both years as well, the average data value is highest to lowest in this
order: “good”, “excellent”, “fair” and “poor”. The spread of the data
value for those who responded “Fair” increased from 2006 to 2010.

## Uploading and cleaning datasets

  read_csv("./nhanes_accel.csv") |>

  mutate(
    seqn = as.factor(seqn)

        2 ~ "female"), 
    education = 
      case_match(
        education, 
        1 ~ "less than HS", 
        2 ~ "HS or HS equivalent",
        3 ~ "more than HS"), 
    sex = as.factor(sex),
    education = as.factor(education),
    seqn = as.factor(seqn)
  )
```

## Merging datasets

``` r
merged_nhanes = 
  left_join(demographic, accelerometer, by = c("seqn")) |>
  drop_na()
```

## Table and visualization for the number of men and women in each education category

``` r

There are more men in this data set than women. Among both women and
men, about half of those have more than a HS education and the remaining
half is split between less than HS and HS/HS equivalent educations. For
both women and men, those who have more than a HS education have a lower
average age than the other two education groups. The average age for the
less than HS and HS/HS equivalent education groups are about the same
for women, but for men, the average age seems to be decreasing as
educational group increases from less than HS to more than HS.

Aggregating across minutes to create a total activity variable for each
participant. This plot comparse men to women and have separate panels
for each education level.

``` r
activities_df = merged_nhanes |>
  group_by(seqn) |>
  mutate(
    total_activity=sum(physical_act))

  facet_grid(.~education) +
  labs(
      x= "age",
      y="total activity",
      title= "total activity among different ages by education level")

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

![](p8105_hw3_lvr2115_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

In the less than HS group, both women’s and men’s total activity drops
with age more significantly than in the more than HS and HS/HS
equivalent groups. In the high school equivalent group, the total
activity for men and women rises until around 45 years old and then
starts to decline, except women’s total activity increases again around
age 60. Interestingly, in the more than HS group, women experience an
increase in total activity around age 65 while men experience a steep
decrease at the same age.

This three-panel plot shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each
education level and uses color to indicate sex.
